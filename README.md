# Training Bipedal Robot with Deep Reinforcement Learning

In this project, I explore applying two deep reinforcement learning techniques, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) to try to solve the BipedalWalker-v2 environment that is part of the Box2D environments onOpenAIâ€™s Gym. This environment consists of a 4-joint walker robot that is given positive reward for moving, "walking", forward.
